- API similar to rlpyt (sampler classes, assemble an algorithm from building blocks, composition)
- configuration (use Hydra?)
- restart workers when they crash, not only when they crash on startup
- transformer support
- get rid of environment families by prefix?







Signal slot:
- it is too tedious to connect all objects that can exchange messages with each other
- we need functionality to essentially broadcast a message to all recepients living on an event loop
- special type of connection for messages, like:

connect(emitter, 'signal', event_loop.broadcast)
